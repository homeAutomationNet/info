Plans for the Home Automation System

- Use C# for Backend, Typescript for Frontend
- Posibility for Js Adapters in Backend (NodeRed) 
- Scripting in Backend via Blockly and C#
- Look at IoBroker for Tag Properties
- No Multi Server support atm.
- Dynamic loading of DLLs via AssemblyLoadContext (so stoped adapters are removeable)
- Nuget for adapter installing, so no installer needed

Frontend

- Habpanel for for Frontend
- AgGrid for Table Views in frontend

Nameing:

Tags => Datapoints from a System (Objects in iobroker)
Adapters => Extension Modules
